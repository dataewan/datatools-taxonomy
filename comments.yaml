Excel: {Automatable: 'It isn''t that much fun most of the time, but there are some
    pretty nice features that work well. Things like conditional formatting or the
    connections to external data sources are pretty nice.', Good for complex tasks: 'Not
    the best for complex stats or complex plotting. You can do these things in Excel,
    but it is trickier than it should be, and feels quite hacky.', Good for easy tasks: 'Really
    useful for simple reporting, especially if you use features like pivot tables.
    Also good that most of your customers will know enough Excel to work with the
    figures themselves in the sheet, if they want to figure things out themself.',
  Good results quickly: Yep. Most of the time you can turn round what you want to
    in a few minutes, Good with big data: Not really good with larger datasets. Better
    than it used to be - there was a max of 65536 rows in older versions, Powerful: 'You
    can make really good products using Excel, but the majority of the time they''re
    not that great.', Training requirements: Pretty much everyone knows at least some
    Excel. You can get folk doing quite complex things pretty quickly.}
