Excel: {Automatable: 'It isn''t that much fun most of the time, but there are some
    pretty nice features that work well. Things like conditional formatting or the
    connections to external data sources are pretty nice.', Flexible: 'Excel is very
    flexible, especially with extra extensions. Doesn''t always mean it is a good
    idea to use Excel as a database, a stats package, etc. You often run into problems
    this way', Fun: 'I don''t think you could really ever describe Excel as fun. There
    are some pretty nice features though, and I have found myself doing things like
    enjoying tweaking the conditional formatting.', Good for complex tasks: 'Not the
    best for complex stats or complex plotting. You can do these things in Excel,
    but it is trickier than it should be, and feels quite hacky.', Good for easy tasks: 'Really
    useful for simple reporting, especially if you use features like pivot tables.
    Also good that most of your customers will know enough Excel to work with the
    figures themselves in the sheet, if they want to figure things out themself.',
  Good results quickly: Yep. Most of the time you can turn round what you want to
    in a few minutes, Good with big data: Not really good with larger datasets. Better
    than it used to be - there was a max of 65536 rows in older versions, Powerful: 'You
    can make really good products using Excel, but the majority of the time they''re
    not that great.', Training requirements: Pretty much everyone knows at least some
    Excel. You can get folk doing quite complex things pretty quickly.}

Powerpoint: {Automatable: 'I''ve never found a system that automates Powerpoint well.
    The closest I''ve got is making plots using another tool, then dumping them into
    Powerpoint.', Flexible: 'Powerpoint is farily flexible, a bit of creativity goes
    a long way. It isn''t great at anything beyond a slide deck, but that''s what
    you really need it for.', Fun: Hard to describe using Powerpoint as fun., Good for complex tasks: 'You
    can make complex plots and layouts using Powerpoint, laying out your results in
    an attractive way is quite easy. It isn''t a very natural tool for any advanced
    plotting, I''d advise that you do that elsewhere, but you can make plots elsewhere
    and then put them in a Powerpoint for general consumption.', Good for easy tasks: 'Powerpoint
    is an easily digestible format for data analysis, especially if you have a clear
    narrative flow. It isn''t a great tool for presenting results, so have a think
    about your other options - written reports are a particularly good alternative.',
  Good results quickly: 'You can knock out a presentation quickly. To get good results
    though, I find you have to spend a long time fiddling about with your slides to
    get them looking just right.', Good with big data: I can't find any evidence of
    Powerpoint being used in a big data environment. I can't see any good reason for
    Powerpoint to be used with big data. Happy to be proved wrong though., Powerful: 'You
    can make some really good stuff using Powerpoint - <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorgan/2011/04/04/if-you-must-use-power-point-heres-how-to-do-it-5-tips-from-hans-rosling/">Hans
    Rosling</a> is very good at this. Masterpieces in Powerpoint are few and far between
    though, you don''t often get a wow factor from Powerpoint.', Training requirements: 'Everyone
    has some experience with Powerpoint and most people can probably bash out a few
    slides easily enough. If you want to make anything more impressive though, it
    becomes increasingly fiddly. Training people how to make good slides in Powerpoint
    is quite difficult.'}
