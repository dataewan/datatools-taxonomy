Excel: {Automatable: 'It isn''t that much fun most of the time, but there are some
    pretty nice features that work well. Things like conditional formatting or the
    connections to external data sources are pretty nice.', Flexible: 'Excel is very
    flexible, especially with extra extensions. Doesn''t always mean it is a good
    idea to use Excel as a database, a stats package, etc. You often run into problems
    this way', Fun: 'I don''t think you could really ever describe Excel as fun. There
    are some pretty nice features though, and I have found myself doing things like
    enjoying tweaking the conditional formatting.', Good for complex tasks: 'Not the
    best for complex stats or complex plotting. You can do these things in Excel,
    but it is trickier than it should be, and feels quite hacky.', Good for easy tasks: 'Really
    useful for simple reporting, especially if you use features like pivot tables.
    Also good that most of your customers will know enough Excel to work with the
    figures themselves in the sheet, if they want to figure things out themself.',
  Good results quickly: Yep. Most of the time you can turn round what you want to
    in a few minutes, Good with big data: Not really good with larger datasets. Better
    than it used to be - there was a max of 65536 rows in older versions, Powerful: 'You
    can make really good products using Excel, but the majority of the time they''re
    not that great.', Training requirements: Pretty much everyone knows at least some
    Excel. You can get folk doing quite complex things pretty quickly.}

Powerpoint: {Automatable: 'I''ve never found a system that automates Powerpoint well.
    The closest I''ve got is making plots using another tool, then dumping them into
    Powerpoint.', Flexible: 'Powerpoint is farily flexible, a bit of creativity goes
    a long way. It isn''t great at anything beyond a slide deck, but that''s what
    you really need it for.', Fun: Hard to describe using Powerpoint as fun., Good for complex tasks: 'You
    can make complex plots and layouts using Powerpoint, laying out your results in
    an attractive way is quite easy. It isn''t a very natural tool for any advanced
    plotting, I''d advise that you do that elsewhere, but you can make plots elsewhere
    and then put them in a Powerpoint for general consumption.', Good for easy tasks: 'Powerpoint
    is an easily digestible format for data analysis, especially if you have a clear
    narrative flow. It isn''t a great tool for presenting results, so have a think
    about your other options - written reports are a particularly good alternative.',
  Good results quickly: 'You can knock out a presentation quickly. To get good results
    though, I find you have to spend a long time fiddling about with your slides to
    get them looking just right.', Good with big data: I can't find any evidence of
    Powerpoint being used in a big data environment. I can't see any good reason for
    Powerpoint to be used with big data. Happy to be proved wrong though., Powerful: 'You
    can make some really good stuff using Powerpoint - <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorgan/2011/04/04/if-you-must-use-power-point-heres-how-to-do-it-5-tips-from-hans-rosling/">Hans
    Rosling</a> is very good at this. Masterpieces in Powerpoint are few and far between
    though, you don''t often get a wow factor from Powerpoint.', Training requirements: 'Everyone
    has some experience with Powerpoint and most people can probably bash out a few
    slides easily enough. If you want to make anything more impressive though, it
    becomes increasingly fiddly. Training people how to make good slides in Powerpoint
    is quite difficult.'}

SQL: {Automatable: 'Automation is really easy using SQL. You have the option of using
    the command line, or there are fantastic libraries for every programming language
    out there. SQL is a very mature tool, so everything knows how to interface with
    it.', Flexible: You can use SQL for a lot more than just extracting data. Simple
    aggregations and reporting are easily possible using the language., Fun: I never
    find it much fun; remembering which table to join on which key or dealing with
    data type problems., Good for complex tasks: 'I don''t use SQL for anything complex.
    Usually it is better to do the complex stats using something else. There are extensions
    for most distributions of SQL that do things like statistics, but it is usually
    better to do anything complex in something else.', Good for easy tasks: 'SQL is
    a fairly good option for running simple repeated reporting. It takes longer to
    do the initial setup of your report, but repeating it is very easy. The output
    isn''t usually very pretty though, so you need to format it before giving it to
    your stakeholders.', Good results quickly: 'It is difficult to make your data
    extract quickly, unless you know your schema like the back of your hand. Also,
    if you want anything more complex than a data table you have to put additional
    work in afterwards.', Good with big data: 'SQL is surprisingly good with "big
    data", <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> seems to cope pretty
    well with big datasets. I''d advise that you give it a try first, before jumping
    into the world of big data tools.', Powerful: 'SQL can''t really do anything amazing
    by itself. You do have a much better chance of making something spectacular if
    you''re backed by a structured database, than if you''re depending on text files
    or other messy data types.', Training requirements: 'SQL takes a bit of time to
    get used to. But, once you have the basics sorted you''ll be very productive.
    You don''t need to be a SQL master to get good results. There are <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page">good
    online tutorials</a> available as well.'}
Tableau: {Automatable: 'Tableau doesn''t provide a scripting language, or much acces
    to the underlying VizQL language. So automation of Tableau itself is fairly limited.
    The best way to automate Tableau is to make your data extracts in another tool,
    then point the Tableau workbook at the automated extract.', Flexible: 'Tableau
    can deal with a wide variety of data formats. It can also do some pretty impressive
    automatic clean up of your data - automatic geo-coding for example. On the other
    hand, it doesn''t work flexibly with certain data sources (for example, getting
    Tableau and an OLAP cube to work together is a painful experience) and getting
    Tableau to do any reasonably complex calculations is difficult and requires you
    to learn hacky tricks.', Fun: 'When you can make something that looks so impressive
    so quickly, Tableau feels fun to use. Sometimes, when you try and use it for something
    outside it''s comfort zone it can be a tremendously frustrating experience to
    use Tableau. Stick to Tableau''s strengths and it is a lot of fun.', Good for complex tasks: 'There
    is some support for things like timeseries forecasting, or advanced plots like
    treemaps and scatter plots. I''d suggest there are better places to do really
    advanced work - you need a proper stats package to do really heavy lifting. For
    moderately advanced work, Tableau is a good option.', Good for easy tasks: 'You
    can make impressive looking results quickly using Tableau, and the plots are easy
    to understand. There are limitations around simple things like table formatting,
    or laying out your plots in a narrative flow, which might make it tricky to do
    simple tasks you are used to doing.', Good results quickly: 'You can make results
    very quickly using Tableau - it is all drag and drop, point and click, easy. If
    you try and go outside Tableau''s comfort zone then you can waste a lot of time,
    but stick to what it is good at and you get your results quickly.', Good with big data: 'Tableau
    has support for a variety of <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/new-features/big-data">big
    data</a> tools. I''ve never tried them, so I can''t comment on how good they are.
    Tabeau seem to be taking this side of their business very seriously.', Powerful: 'People
    can make very fancy looking dashboards using Tableau, with fancy plots and lots
    of interactivity. These plots and interactivity are fairly standard though. I''d
    suggest that there hasn''t really been a "wow" data visualisation that uses Tableau,
    but I''m happy to be proved wrong.', Training requirements: Tableau is very easy
    to use. There are also lots of good training courses if you want to send people
    on them to get them working quickly.}
