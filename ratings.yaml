      comment: It isn't that much fun most of the time, but there are some pretty
        nice features that work well. Things like conditional formatting or the connections
        to external data sources are pretty nice.

      comment: Excel is very flexible, especially with extra extensions. Doesn't always
        mean it is a good idea to use Excel as a database, a stats package, etc. You
        often run into problems this way

      comment: I don't think you could really ever describe Excel as fun. There are
        some pretty nice features though, and I have found myself doing things like
        enjoying tweaking the conditional formatting.

      comment: Not the best for complex stats or complex plotting. You can do these
        things in Excel, but it is trickier than it should be, and feels quite hacky.

      comment: Really useful for simple reporting, especially if you use features
        like pivot tables. Also good that most of your customers will know enough
        Excel to work with the figures themselves in the sheet, if they want to figure
        things out themself.

      comment: I've never found a system that automates Powerpoint well. The closest
        I've got is making plots using another tool, then dumping them into Powerpoint.

      comment: Powerpoint is farily flexible, a bit of creativity goes a long way.
        It isn't great at anything beyond a slide deck, but that's what you really
        need it for.

      comment: You can make complex plots and layouts using Powerpoint, laying out
        your results in an attractive way is quite easy. It isn't a very natural tool
        for any advanced plotting, I'd advise that you do that elsewhere, but you
        can make plots elsewhere and then put them in a Powerpoint for general consumption.

      comment: Powerpoint is an easily digestible format for data analysis, especially
        if you have a clear narrative flow. It isn't a great tool for presenting results,
        so have a think about your other options - written reports are a particularly
        good alternative.

      comment: You can knock out a presentation quickly. To get good results though,
        I find you have to spend a long time fiddling about with your slides to get
        them looking just right.

      comment: I can't find any evidence of Powerpoint being used in a big data environment.
        I can't see any good reason for Powerpoint to be used with big data. Happy
        to be proved wrong though.

        Rosling</a> is very good at this. Masterpieces in Powerpoint are few and far
        between though, you don't often get a wow factor from Powerpoint.

      comment: Everyone has some experience with Powerpoint and most people can probably
        bash out a few slides easily enough. If you want to make anything more impressive
        though, it becomes increasingly fiddly. Training people how to make good slides
        in Powerpoint is quite difficult.
