        Excel to work with the figures themselves in the sheet, if they want to figure

      comment: Tableau doesn't provide a scripting language, or much acces to the
        underlying VizQL language. So automation of Tableau itself is fairly limited.
        The best way to automate Tableau is to make your data extracts in another
        tool, then point the Tableau workbook at the automated extract.

      comment: Tableau can deal with a wide variety of data formats. It can also do
        some pretty impressive automatic clean up of your data - automatic geo-coding
        for example. On the other hand, it doesn't work flexibly with certain data
        sources (for example, getting Tableau and an OLAP cube to work together is
        a painful experience) and getting Tableau to do any reasonably complex calculations
        is difficult and requires you to learn hacky tricks.
