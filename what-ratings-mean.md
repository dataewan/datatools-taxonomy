# Good results quickly

Can you make your output quickly using this tool?

This doesn't mean how fast it runs, rather it means how much time you need to spend with the tool before you get your results.
For example, Python would score higher than C on this measure.
You have to spend less analyst time programming Python to get good results than C,
even though the compiled C code will probably run faster.


# Training requirements

How much time and effort is it for the average* user to become productive with this tool.

*Average user in this case probably isn't an average computer user. I mean someone who is numerate, analytical and has a little bit of prior programming experience.

# Flexible

Is this tool good for just one kind of task, or can it do lots of different different things?
What happens if you try and use it to do something outside the tool's comfort zone?

If it can do these things, is this tool good enough at different things.
Just because you [can use Excel as a painting tool](http://www.odditycentral.com/art/stunning-japanese-paintings-created-in-microsoft-excel.html), 
doesn't necessarily mean you should use Excel to do your painting.

# Automatable

I try and never spend 5 minutes doing a task if I can spend 30 minutes writing a script that automates the same task.
The benefit of this is two-fold:

 * If I have to do that task more than 6 times, I've saved myself time.
 * Often, the same script can be adapted slightly to perform a wide range of tasks - saving myself even more time.

So this measure is all about how well the tool plays with automation tools.
Is it easy to automate this tool?
Is it easy to get it to interface with other tools?

# Powerful

Can this make very impressive results that would be difficult for other tools to create.
Are you going to be able to make a masterpiece using this tool?

# Good for easy tasks

Is this tool good for your day-to-day tasks?
For example:
simple numeric reporting like filtering, aggregation and simple summarisation.
Simple data visualisation like bar graphs or line plots.

# Good for complex tasks

Is this tool good for more complicated tasks?
Heavy statistical analysis; regression, clustering, classification, etc.
More sophisticated plotting; box-plots, interactivity, non-standard plots, etc. 

# Good with "big data"

It is really difficult to quantify what "big data" means.
I'm not really sure if there is a good definition of what people mean by big data.
What I mean here is a fairly simple definition: how well does this tool work with datasets around the terrabyte order of magnitude or greater?

# Fun

How much fun do you have when you are using this tool?
Is it frustrating to use, or do you constantly amaze yourself with what it can do?
